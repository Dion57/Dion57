### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ“Œ I am [Nnakenyi Gideon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deon-nichole-035a70177/)

ðŸ“Œ This is a brief intro about me:

- Finished University --> Moved Into Networking --> Cloud/DevOps Engineer
  
- I love security, problem-solving, learning new skills, and implementing them to solve different challenges.

ðŸ“Œ On this page, you will come acrosss most of the various projects I'll be working on. They may include `Azure Cloud`, `DevOps`, `Kubernetes`, `MySql`, `MariaDb`, `Bash Scripting`, `Terraform`.

| Repository  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [MFA_in_Active_Directory](https://github.com/Dion57/MFA_in_Active_Directory)  | How to implement Multi Factor Authentication in any Azure Active Directory  |

ðŸ“Œ However, I'm still open to learn more. I have passion for security. This is why I'm actively pushing towards cloud security and DevSecOps.
